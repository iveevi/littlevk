# littlevk

A light, ergonomic, non-intrusive, single-header wrapper for jump starting
visualization applications using Vulkan. Relies on **C++20** for modern
metaprogramming functionality.

***Philosophy:*** littlevk is designed to accelerating the development of
various computer graphics applications built using Vulkan. It aims to minimize
the amount of repetitive boilerplate, while simoultaneously enabling full
control over how resources are constructed and used.
