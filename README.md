# littlevk

A light, non-intrusive, single-header wrapper for jump starting visualization applications using Vulkan.

 <!-- non-intrusive: use the Vulkan API likebefore, littlevk avoids forcing users to adopt to a new philosophy -->
 <!-- reduce the headache of manually keeping track of deallocations -->
